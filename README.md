# Introduction
During the Covid-19 pandemic, nearly all people over the world rely on computers to study and do their works. It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the risk of losing access to the files in our computers due to accidental causes such as file corruption or deletion of data.

# Project Name
AutoBackup

# About Project
As the name of my project suggests, this project tries to make a solution and implement a way to help and ease the task of taking backup files using latest technologies like Docker, SpringBoot, Java, Python and JavaScript.

Another main feature of my project is that it allows users to compare 2 documents which contains text side by side (similar to Github).

# System Architecture
## Backend-end Development Architecture
During my time at Ericsson company, I learned much about Cloud Native Technologies. I decided to build my dockerized application using Java, specifically the Spring Boot framework. This was primarily chosen due to being familiar with Spring, and the ease of developing REST-service controllers and data repositories with it.

## Front-end Development Architecture
JavaScript, HTML and CSS are the technologies I needed to create the UI for my project from Scratch. Working with different technologies and putting them together resulted in a responsive multipages web app.

## Database
The data for my project is stored in amazon RDS database. The main reason I decided to switch from local MySQL container to amazon RDS is that there is no chance of data loss using amazon RDS.
